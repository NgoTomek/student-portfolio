# Student Portfolio - Project Status

## Completed Tasks

### TypeScript Migration
- Created TypeScript architecture and type definitions
- Converted key components from JavaScript to TypeScript:
  - ProjectCard component
  - NetworkStatus component
  - Footer component
  - Toast component
  - useNetworkStatus hook
  - ProtectedRoutes component
  - AuthContext
- Implemented comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`
- Added TypeScript testing and validation via `check-ts.js`

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented URL sanitization in `urlUtils.ts` to prevent XSS attacks
- Added comprehensive security utilities in `securityUtils.ts`:
  - HTML sanitization
  - Input validation
  - Password strength checking
  - Suspicious content detection
- Created Firestore security rules for proper access control
- Implemented Storage security rules for file uploads
- Added error handling utilities in `errorUtils.ts`
- Created runtime type checking utilities in `typeUtils.ts`
- Created security audit script to check for vulnerabilities
- Implemented security rules deployment script

### Documentation & Testing
- Enhanced README with comprehensive documentation
- Added detailed testing and troubleshooting instructions
- Created manual testing checklist
- Implemented security validation tools

## Outstanding Issues

### TypeScript Errors
- `AuthContext.tsx` has TypeScript errors related to Firebase auth typing
- Several unused exports detected throughout the codebase

### Security Issues
- Several components use insecure HTTP URLs instead of HTTPS
- Some hardcoded strings are being flagged as potential secrets
- Insecure localStorage usage in cacheService.js
- Security audit script itself contains patterns it flags as issues

### Next Steps

#### High Priority
1. Fix TypeScript errors in AuthContext.tsx
2. Replace all HTTP URLs with HTTPS
3. Address remaining security issues flagged by security audit
4. Complete conversion of remaining components to TypeScript

#### Medium Priority
1. Organize and clean up unused exports
2. Improve error handling throughout the application
3. Enhance localStorage security in cacheService.js
4. Add more automated tests

#### Low Priority
1. Optimize bundle size
2. Add more documentation
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline
4. Enhance accessibility features

## Deployment Readiness

The application is partially ready for deployment. Before final deployment:

1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
2. Address critical security issues
3. Run comprehensive tests
4. Complete Firebase configuration and security rules deployment
